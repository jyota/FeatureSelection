Multivariate feature selection with hybrid heuristic search approach.
Feature selection is driven by Hotelling-Lawley Trace statistic (parametric).

Main usage is likely the hybridFeatureSelection function, which takes:
- Data frame of predictors as x
- Vector / column of class(es) as y
- 'start' parameter is method to select first variable for the search (can be 'random' or 'Hotelling')
- stopP parameter is number of features to select before ending search
- stopT2 parameter specifies Hotelling-Lawley trace statistic to reach before ending search
(meeting either stopP or stopT2 will end search)
The function performs a heuristic search to find the best (local) optima until it hits one of the stop parameters. 

There is also a modified bagging routine to obtain out of bag estimates for features including LDA classification accuracy for a 2 class scenario (perhaps additional class scenarios will be supported at some time).

Concepts, approach, hybrid feature selection, and modified bagging schema were adapted into R from Darius Dziuda's 2010 "Data Mining for Genomics & Proteomics" book.
