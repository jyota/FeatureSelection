Multivariate feature selection with hybrid heuristic search approach.
Feature selection is driven by Hotelling-Lawley Trace statistic (parametric).

Main usage is likely the hybridFeatureSelection function, which takes:
- Data frame of predictors as x
- Vector / column of class(es) as y
- 'start' parameter is method to select first variable for the search (can be 'random', 'Hotelling', or 'randomForest')
- stopP parameter is number of features to select before ending search
- stopT2 parameter specifies Hotelling-Lawley trace statistic to reach before ending search
(meeting either stopP or stopT2 will end search)
The function performs a heuristic search to find the best (local) optima until it hits one of the stop parameters. 

It is recommended to run the search more than once as it is not a global search. There is an automatic routine I wrote for performing multiple searches in this manner: ensembleFeatureSelection(x, y, n, stopP, stopT2), where n is the number of hybridFeatureSelection searches to run (random starting variable); other parameters are as for the hybridFeatureSelection function. It returns a table of votes per feature based on the multiple heuristic searches performed.
It is possible that I will add the capacity to perform multiple searches with other R feature selection packages and return votes for features based on multiple feature selection runs.
